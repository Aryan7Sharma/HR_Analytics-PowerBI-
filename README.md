## Purpose

1). Let Suppose you are HR Manager in XYZ Company So you have track a all details about Presences of your Employees.


2). So whenever you need to see a any Particular Employee total Presence or a Sick leave or in total presences how many days he/she do a Work From Home So for checking all of those you have to go through a lot of Excel Files this will waste your lot of time and you have do all tracks manually by excel files.


3). After Seeing all those Pain points I create Presence Analysis Dashboard with the help of Power BI Where HR Manger and Stakeholders Can easily Visualize and get all insights in a Single Page.


4). On the Dashboard you can get a all details about employee presence for each month or a about a partcular date or for particular employees.


5). These Insights help the HR Mangars and Directors to know about a Precences like in which month most people are on the leave So they know in which month there work force is higher or low.


6). With the help of this Dashwoard Hr also get a insight about on which weekdays their work force is high so he/she can organize the activities according to that.
